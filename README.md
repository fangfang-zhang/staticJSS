# staticJSS
General Introduction:
1. The program can be run with -file /home/fzhang/eclipse-workspace/GPJSS-master/src/yimei/jss/algorithm/coevolutiongp/coevolutiongp-dynamic.params
2. Dataset was downloaded from https://people.idsia.ch/~monaldo/fjsp.html
3. All instances in a data file are used to build static training instances, i.e., the arrival time of all operations = 0, and weights of jobs are 1 (the  same). The decision marking process can be regarded as the same as in a dynamic simulation, but the very initial stage is considered, i.e., a number of jobs come together at the beginning.
